Project Summary
===============
A website and database that would allow users to enter information about various job offers (co-ops, internships, full-time positions) so that they could compare the overall compensation between their various job offers.  The website would also facilitate users creating a customizable *quantitative and qualitative* pros/cons list for each of the positions. The pros/cons list would be pre-populated with common job attributes, as well the personal priorities for each individual user.  The application could also produce a *score* or *rating* for each job offer, based on individual weightings that the user assigns to each pro/con entry.  Essentially, the user would be creating an *equation* for calculating and valuing the overall worth of each job offer.

Here are some more details (requirements) to consider:
* Typical *quantitative* job offer information includes salary, signing bonus, relocation or housing expenses, annual bonus, paid time off (vacation, holidays, sick days, etc.), 401k, pension (rare), insurance benefits and premiums (health, dental, vision, life, etc...), educational benefits, etc.  There can be additional quantitative aspects to a job offer.  You should research those.

* Typical *qualitative* considerations are company culture, company size, company age and stability, location, commute time, work-life balance, work schedule (in-person, remote, hybrid, 5 x 8, 4 x 10, 9/80, flex, etc.), breadth of work, availability for mentorship, learning and growth and promotion opportunities, required travel, etc.  Again, you should research those.

* Customizable considerations could be on-site facilities (parking garage, fitness center, cafeteria, walking trails, etc.), friends as co-workers, previous co-op/internship position, live-at-home, roommates, sustainability, social conscience, etc.  The suer would be able to enter those aspects that are important to them.

* For each company/position, users would be presented with a questionaire form to fill out with the various quantifiable aspects listed above.  They would also be able to answer a questionaire about the qualitative aspects of each position - indicating their level of importance - this could be a 1-10 scale, or some other metric range.

* The above information could then be used to create a pros/cons list for each company and the information for multiple companies could then be recalled in a grid fashion for the user to compare.

* The user would also need to create log-in credentials to protect the privacy of their information.

* The user would need to be able to edit/modify/delete the information for a compamy.

**As a stretch goal** - create an equation that would allow the user to specify the relative importance of each aspect of the quantitative and qualitative information that they supplied for each offer/position.
